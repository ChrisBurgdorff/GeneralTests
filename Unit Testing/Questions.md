## Question 1:

You have the following function:

`bool isEven(number) {...`

It returns `true` if a number is even, and `false` if a number is odd. What values for `number` would you use if you were designing tests for this function?

## Question 2:

You're given a function that counts how many times each alphanumeric character appears within a given string.

**For example:**
`"aabbbc"` returns:

```
[ {'a': 2}, {'b': 3}, {'c': 1} ]
```

What values would you use to test it?
