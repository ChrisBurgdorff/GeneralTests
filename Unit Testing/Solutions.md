## Unit Testing

There are no right or wrong answers to these questions. The keys are to get an idea about the candidate's though process **and** how well they communicate. 

Ideally, they want to consider any and all *edge cases*. You want to make sure they aren't making too many assumptions and if whatever assumptions they are making are at least communicated (eg. I'm going to assume that the only values it accepts are integers)
